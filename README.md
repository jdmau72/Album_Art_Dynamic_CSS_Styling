WIP 2025
Start of a Flask-based website to display album artwork for various albums, including front and back album artwork, innerfold art, liner notes, all that. 
Uses Flask, some JS, and currently SQLite for a basic database
Also includes ThemeExtractor.py, a script to extract the dominant color theme from an album artwork and use that to style the page, similar to how Spotify style's an album page.
